## Background

## Experiment
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
As mentioned above, there are 20 audio features contained in our music dataset. To get a high-level understanding of our dataset, we conduct simple EDA in this section. Since the features *acousticness*, *danceability*, *energy*, *instrumentalness*, *liveness*, *speechiness* and *valence* have values ranged within 0 and 1, it is easier to analyze them together as a group. Shown in Figure below (add figure later), we can see that most of audio features, except for *liveness*, have quite different distribution between the top and the non-top. For example, *instrumentalness* for top songs has very densed distribution near value 0, this means that top songs have more vocal content.
